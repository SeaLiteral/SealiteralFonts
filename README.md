# SealiteralFonts
Some fonts that I've made while trying to make games. For now there's only one here: LeerTales. I also tried to make another while learning to use FontForge, but it isn't as readable as I'd want it to. I might add it sometime, but I'm just as likely to make another one, maybe remake the first one now that I know how to make line widths more consistent.

## LeerTales
I made this one for a jam game that the programmers didn't finish. It has a spooky sci-fi look to it:
- The ascenders and descenders are tall, like tall columns in a room that's intentionally very large to make the people in it feel small.
- The descenders on lowercase j, g and y are curled downwards to look a bit unusual.
- The letters are made from obvious geometric shapes like lines and arcs, making it geometric and modern.
- To make the shapes even more obvious, I made holes in them. Also, the theme of the jam was "cutting corners", so making holes in the lines where there should be corners seemed to go well with the theme. Cutting letters in part would also have worked with the idea that the player in the game could build stuff.

### Todo
- Add whichever ASCII characters I haven't added yet (I think that would be things like the dollar sign and the at sign, but I have most of that stuff already).
- Improve Latin-1 coverage (add some letters that aren't used in English and are very rare in Danish, then add things like mathematical symbols).
- Improve kerning.
- Add some characters that aren't in Latin-1 but are used in languages like French and Esperanto. (Probably not needed for 1.0)
- Add the Greek alphabet.
- Maybe add the Shavian alphabet.
